Note this payment will **continue until you stop it**. (You can stop it from the **My preapproved payments** section on the [PayPal web site](https://www.paypal.com/), or you can send us mail.)

[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) charges a **`$0.30 + 2.9%` transaction fee**, so it’s not a good choice for large donations. To avoid this fee, either send a check (below) or have your bank/brokerage send funds directly. Contact Avril Kenney or Rob Calhoun to arrange this.
